# 🚗 Parking Spot Detection and Counter using Computer Vision

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **computer vision–based parking spot detection and counting system** built using Python and OpenCV. It analyzes video footage of a parking lot to detect individual parking spaces, determine whether they are occupied or vacant, and display the number of available spots in real time.

The system is designed to work on pre-recorded video input and demonstrates how image processing techniques can be applied to solve real-world smart parking problems.

## 🎯 Features

* Detects predefined parking spaces from video input
* Classifies parking spots as **occupied or vacant**
* Displays **real-time count** of available parking spaces
* Annotated video output with visual indicators
* Efficient and lightweight computer vision pipeline

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **OpenCV**
* **NumPy**

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Video frames are captured and processed in real time
2. Each frame undergoes preprocessing (grayscale, thresholding, noise reduction)
3. Predefined parking regions are analyzed to detect vehicle presence
4. Pixel intensity / contour analysis determines occupancy status
5. The system updates and displays the count of free and occupied spaces
